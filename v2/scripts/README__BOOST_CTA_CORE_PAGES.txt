TKFM NEXT POWER MOVE — PUT BOOST CTA WHERE PEOPLE ACTUALLY CLICK

This patch injects a clean “Rotation Boost” CTA block into:
- radio-hub.html
- owner-paid-lane-inbox.html
- owner-boost-dashboard.html
- owner-boost-analytics.html

Buttons use:
rotation_boost_7d / rotation_boost_30d
and the existing tkfm checkout wiring.
