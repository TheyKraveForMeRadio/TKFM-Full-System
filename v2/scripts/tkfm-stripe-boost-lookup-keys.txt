WHAT TO PASTE INTO NETLIFY ENV (after you create prices)
========================
Set these to the Stripe PRICE IDs you create:

STRIPE_PRICE_ROTATION_BOOST_7D=price_XXXXXXXXXXXX
STRIPE_PRICE_ROTATION_BOOST_30D=price_XXXXXXXXXXXX

(If your code is lookup‑key based already, you still want these as a safe fallback.)

========================
QUICK VERIFY (after prices exist)
========================
1) Confirm buttons are using:
data-plan="rotation_boost_7d"  and  data-plan="rotation_boost_30d"
(or your existing ids, but lookup keys must match the plan id mapping)

2) Run your owner verifier page (if installed) and confirm:
- it finds rotation_boost_7d / rotation_boost_30d
- checkout redirects to Stripe successfully
